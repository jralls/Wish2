To compile the kernel module:

step 1: The kernel modules will not be installed or compiled unless you 
are running on the kernel that you intend to run the drivers with. 
Read docs/index2.html for more or http://wish.sourceforge.net/index2.html.

step 2: make patchkernel

step 3: go to kernel source directory and rebuild the configuration
        (make menuconfig, or make xconfig).  In the kernel configurtion
	select "Device Drivers"
	then select "Character devices"
	scroll to the bottom
	make sure that "/dev/x10 API driver" is selected to compile as a module

step 4: remake your kernel and modules

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
To load the kernel module:

type "modprobe x10"

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
To compile the userspace drivers:

type "make"

To run the userspace drivers:

load the driver that is associated with your device.
