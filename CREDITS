The need for a transceiver agnostic driver for Linux would likely have not
been recognized had heyu (www.heyu.org) been created for the CM11A.

Dr. Pete Whiting created the concept of mapping the units of a X10 network to 
/dev character devices.

The book "Linux Device Drivers, 2nd Edition" by Alessandro Rubini, Jonathan 
Corbet was by far the most useful resource for this project.


And, thanks to Sprint for laying me off and giving me 6 months of severance
pay and a non-compete that gave me the time to do the work to develop the code.

The X10 drivers were created by Scott Hiles
